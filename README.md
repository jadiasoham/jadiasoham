- 👋 Hi, I’m @jadiasoham, a passionate learner and educator in the realms of physics, Python, and data science.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the fascinating connections between physics principles, programming, and data analysis.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer in Data Analytics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, where I’m integrating my love for physics with advanced data analysis techniques.
- 💞️ I’m excited to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between physics, programming, and data analytics to solve real-world problems and uncover new insights!
- 📫 Reach me via email at jadiasoham@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/soham-jadia.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once conducted an experiment to demonstrate Newton's laws of motion using nothing but marbles and a skateboard!
